                <h5>New Art Direciton</h5>
                <p>When I began as a designer at University of Maryland's business school, the major challenge we faced was a lack of consistency across the school's various design outlets. The school's website, degree programs, event brochures, and other print deliverables all had wildly different visual directions, creating dissonance and confusion for their audience.</p>
                <p>Our first priority was to create a single shared design language that all material would draw from going forward. Leadership wanted to maintain a certain level of individuality between each of the school's design outlets (event promos would still be distinct from material advertising degrees, for example) but now they would appear to be fruit from singular tree.</p>

            <p>The process was extremely incremental, as leadership slowly opened up to the new direction, but overtime we gained more creative freedom.</p>
