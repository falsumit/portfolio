            <h3>London Royal American Football Club</h3>
            <p>Graphic Design graduate thesis for Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>
            <p>The London Royal American Football Club is a National Football League expansion team based in London, England.</p>
            <p>It is an exploration of brand identity through sport. Royal is not simply a collection of logos, colors, and uniforms, but the culmination of hours of research and iteration.</p>

            <p>Print Design Final Project for Maryland Institute College of Art.</p>
            <p>​​​​​​​TypeCon is a rebrand of the popular annual typography conference, held in a different city each year. Set in the city of Messina, Sicily, with its rich multicultural history, the design is based on the concept of collegare — Italian for connect.</p>
            <p>The custom logo type was created with unorthodox ligatures and tails, and the design includes patterns and colors that emphaisze the theme of connection, as well as the mediterranean setting.</p>

            <h3>The Work of Saul Bass</h3>
            <p>Print Design Project for Maryland Institute College of Art. </p>
            <p>​​​​​​​​​​​​​The Work of Saul & Elaine Bass is a brochure for a museum exhibit documenting the life and work of two of the most prolific designers of all time. </p>
            <p>Drawing from the book "20 Iconic Film Posters by Saul Bass" by Jennifer Bass & Pat Kirkham, I scanned and vectorized imagery from some of Saul & Elaine's most prominent title sequences to create a collage which serves as the centerpiece of the design.</p>
